# The Trusted IoT Alliance Integration Pattern Reference architecture 
## Introduction

The Trusted IoT Alliance Reference Architecture is a synthesis of more than 4 years of experiences with the integration between the Internet of Things.

The most promising application of IoT and Blockchain is the creation of digital twins of connected physical assets.	
	
## Digital Twins

A digital twin is a persistent digital object whose digital lifecycle tracks the state of a physical object. Blockchain technology is well suited towards the creation of digital twins because a distributed naturally lends itâ€™s self to tracking the life cycle of a singleton objects.

The connection between a physical asset can strengthened and trust can be reduced through the application of secure IoT technologies. There applications in this domain from fraud prevention to supply chain finance to trading.
