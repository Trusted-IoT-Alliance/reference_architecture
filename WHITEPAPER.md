# The Trusted IoT Alliance Integration Pattern Reference architecture 
## Introduction

The Trusted IoT Alliance Reference Architecture is a synthesis of more than 4 years of experiences with the integration between the Internet of Things.

The most promising application of IoT and Blockchain is the creation of digital twins of connected physical assets.	
	
## Digital Twins

A digital twin is a persistent digital object whose digital lifecycle tracks the state of a physical object. Blockchain technology is well suited towards the creation of digital twins because a distributed naturally lends it’s self to tracking the life cycle of a singleton objects.

The connection between a physical asset can strengthened and trust can be reduced through the application of secure IoT technologies. There applications in this domain from fraud prevention to supply chain finance to trading.

Trusted IoT devices should attempt preserve the end to end principle for signatures.
